TODO:

+ make code fit into slides
+ make sure it's a story said by the code
+ extraction slides
  +  architecture
    + maybe just use UML component diagram?
    + create another image (REST vs GQL)
    + improve readability
- NOPE, no data image with stats per optimization attempt, just to show how it worked
+ image with monitoring solution


+ add images with stats
+ create a repated summary slide with `monitor-optimize-deploy`

* image with stats about first, failed attempt: failed cat jump or sth like this
~ last slides or two with the final thoughts
  ~ _fail earlier so you can succeed sooner_ ?
* add summaries & quotes
  * flood of requests  ?
  * server-side filtering -> maybe just the stats?
  + power of joins - some database dude
  * local data - netscape guy
  * use the domain  - Yoda
  * I don't always test on prod, but when I do I do it on Friday - prod testing guy
* title, intro & about
* images for talking
* add funny images

* which week was the one with Friday deploy?
* make sure you have time to tell about your feelings

Visual
* ruby sytax highlighing:
  * consts
  * ivars


Intro
* focus on monitoring
* symptoms of failures (e.g 429 errors)

Story
* show the cycle of monitoring (charts) - optimizing (code) - deploy and again monitoring (charts)
